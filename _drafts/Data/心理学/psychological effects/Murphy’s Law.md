[[墨菲定律]]。Murphy’s Law is one of [[psychological effects]]. The more you fear something happening, the more likely it is to occur. 

At the core of this **phenomenon** lies the power of focus and the subconscious mind. When we fear something intensely, our minds can become preoccupied with that fear, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

This is often linked to [[confirmation bias]], where we **inadvertently** focus on and amplify the signals that confirm our fears, while **disregarding** evidence to the contrary.
